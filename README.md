# Vasiliy Kotovskiy — Backend / Platform Engineer

I build high-load backend systems in **Node.js**: real-time pipelines, stateful event-driven platforms, and performance-critical infrastructure where **predictable latency** matters more than fancy abstractions.

- **Focus:** performance, reliability, observability, minimal overhead
- **Stack:** Node.js / JavaScript, HTTP/WebSocket, MongoDB, Linux, Docker
- **Interests:** Node/V8 internals, runtime behavior, Chromium/Electron patching

## Pet project

### SwarmMachina
**A personal engineering playground / ecosystem** for building **zero-dependency**, high-performance backend infrastructure (HTTP/WebSocket core, shared standards, tooling).

- GitHub org: [SwarmMachina](https://github.com/SwarmMachina)
- Philosophy: **simple internals**, **tight control**, **minimal moving parts**

## What I build

### Real-time & high-load backend
- Data ingestion + normalization from **20–40 sources**
- Services handling up to **10k RPS**
- High-frequency updates (~**50ms** cadence), TTL-based freshness, consistency under churn
- Hot-path optimization to reduce latency and GC pressure

### Stateful event-driven automation (messaging workflows)
- Scenario engine: triggers, auto-replies, warm-up flows, timers, TTL
- Orchestrating **1–3k active dialogues**, **200–500 scenarios**, **20–80 events/sec**
- Retries, deduplication, state recovery
- Real-time HTTP/WebSocket updates with **50–100ms** predictable latency

### Platform engineering
- Custom **HTTP/WebSocket frameworks** with minimal overhead
- **Zero-dependency** approach when it improves control and reliability
- Internal tooling and admin panels (Vue 3) focused on engineering workflows

### Runtime / browser engineering (side track, but I enjoy it)
- Patching and building **Chromium / Electron** from source
- Integrating custom builds with backend services

## Currently exploring
- Zero-deps patterns for production-grade Node.js services
- V8 / Node.js internals, profiling, GC behavior
- Chromium/Electron build & patch workflows
